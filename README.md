# Jobby App Frontend README

Welcome to the Jobby App frontend repository! This README will guide you through the procedures and mechanisms of the frontend project.

## Project Overview

Jobby App is a React-based web application designed to provide users with a seamless job search experience. It offers features such as user authentication, dynamic job filtering, and detailed job information. With Jobby App, users can explore job listings, view profiles, and make informed career decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: The core framework used for building the frontend components and managing the application state.
- **Redux**: For managing application state in a predictable manner, especially useful for larger applications.
- **React Router**: For declarative routing in the application, enabling navigation between different views.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API to fetch job listings and user data.
- **Material-UI**: Provides a set of React components following Google's Material Design guidelines, used for building a sleek and responsive user interface.

## Third-Party Authentication

Jobby App integrates with a third-party authentication service for user authentication. The authentication process is handled externally, allowing users to sign in securely using their existing accounts.
